# 👋 Hi there, I’m Nina Grant

🎓 I’m a climate scientist and science communicator currently finishing my PhD, where I work at the intersection of **climate modeling**, **geoengineering**, and **science policy**.

🌍 I care deeply about using science to support smart, equitable climate decisions—and making complex ideas accessible to the public.

🛰️ My research involves:
- Downscaling global climate model output with machine learning 📉
- Exploring the risks of solar geoengineering aka climate intervention ☀️🛑
- Developing tools for better data analysis & visualization in climate science 🔬📊

🎙️ I also:
- Serve as an AGU Local Science Partner 👩‍🔬🤝
- Work for a new nonprofit focused on science communication 🗣️
- Write and speak about climate for the public, media, and policy audiences 📰🎤
